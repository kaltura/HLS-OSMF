Building the Kaltura HLS Plugin
===============================

To build the Kaltura HLS plugin, import the following projects into your workspace in FlashBuilder 4.6. The recommended version of the Flex SDK is 4.5.1.

   * hlsPlugin - This is the SWC.
   * KalturaHLSPlugin - This packages the SWC into a loadable OSMF SWF plugin.
   * OSMF - the version of OSMF that the plugin uses.
   * OSMFUtils - Some utilties for TestPlayer.
   * TestPlayer - A rudimentary test player provided by Digital Primates.

Set Library Path Dependencies for each of the projects:

    hlsPlugin depends on...
		OSMF project
	KalturaHLSPlugin depends on...
		hlsPlugin project
	OSMFUtils depends on...
		OSMF project
	TestPlayer depends on...
		OSMF project
		OSMFUtils project
		
Project References for each of the projects:

	hlsPlugin
		OSMF
	KalturaHLSPlugin
		hlsPlugin
		OSMF
	OSMFUtils
		OSMF
	TestPlayer
		OSMF
		OSMFUtils

Build them all to get the KalturaHLSPlugin.swf from the 
KalturaHLSPlugin/bin-debug folder. This may then be loaded in the Kaltura Player (or any OSMF-based player).

**Note:** You have to make sure that you set the project references correctly or OSMF won't be bundled with the SWF, and errors will occur due to incompatible versions.

Building With Make
==================

As an alternative to using Flash Builder, you may also use make to compile the plugins, libraries, and test player.

1. The osmf.swc file must be removed from your 4.6.0 sdk folder (in 4.6.0/frameworks/libs)
2. These lines must be changed to fit your local environment https://github.com/kaltura/HLS-OSMF/tree/master//Makefile#L6-L8, https://github.com/kaltura/HLS-OSMF/tree/master/OSMF/OSMF-build-config.xml#L69-L70, and https://github.com/kaltura/HLS-OSMF/tree/master/OSMFUtils/OSMFUtils-build-config.xml#L69-L70
3. Comment out the reference to OSMF in the flex-onfig.xml file in your 4.6.0 sdk (4.6.0/frameworks/flex-config.xml). This may require you change permission settings.
4. Run `make` in the base directory

**NOTE:** In order to run the TestPlayer visualizer, and to enable extra logging, the CONFIG::LOGGING value must be set to true here: https://github.com/kaltura/HLS-OSMF/blob/master/HLSPlugin/HLS-build-config.xml#L12

**NOTE 2:** The Makefile will only fully work on unix-like systems. If run on a DOS system, make will be unable to determine if files have been updated, and will require a manual clean before each new build. Additionally, the `make clean` command will not work. This means that for a manual clean, the built files must be deleted using the explorer.

### The Debug Visualization 

![Manifest Visualization](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/70076/1718358/QwaZnBtZ6wpAPMB/abc-live-throttled.png)
![Transcoder and Download Visualization](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/70076/961665/q1B3iAV532gFnkY/YAY.PNG)

A full featured debug visualizer is included with the HLS OSMF plugin to help with development and testing. It visualises MPEGTS->FLV transcoding, segment download activity, and manifest state and segment selection.

See TestPlayer/html-template/index.hml for details.

The visualizer is written in HTML/JS and requires the plugin to call certain methods via ExternalInterface for proper functioning. Javascript callbacks only occur if CONFIG::LOGGING is true at compile time.
Intructions follow to integrate the Debug Visualizer into your own web page.

These instructions assume you are starting from the [index.template.html](https://github.com/kaltura/HLS-OSMF/blob/master/TestPlayer/html-template/index.template.html). Extrapolate these insstructions as required.

1. Build the TestPlayer.swf. See "Building with Make" for instructions.
2. Copy the [swfobject.js](https://github.com/kaltura/HLS-OSMF/blob/master/TestPlayer/html-template/swfobject.js]), [sources.xml](https://github.com/kaltura/HLS-OSMF/blob/master/TestPlayer/html-template/sources.xml), and the generated TestPlayer.swf into the index directory.
3. Adjust the variables to fit your requirements, specifically, make sure ${swf} points to the location of the TestPlayer.swf.
4. Copy the [visualizer script](https://github.com/kaltura/HLS-OSMF/blob/BJG-BetterBitSwitching/TestPlayer/html-template/index.html#L64-L585) into your index.html.
5. Copy the [visualizer HTML Tags](https://github.com/kaltura/HLS-OSMF/blob/BJG-BetterBitSwitching/TestPlayer/html-template/index.html#L633-L636) into your index.html.
